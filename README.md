# image_feature_analysis

* In the x-ray generated images of concrete structures with cracks, the location of the cracks are being presented in the form of (r, theta, alpha)
* Here, r = radial distance of the centre oof the crack from the mid of the top-edge of the image
        theta = angle that the radial vector from the mid of top-edge to the centre of the crack is making with the vertical
        alpha = the inclination of the crack
Below is the example of the x-ray image being worked on
